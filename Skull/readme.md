The CSS statement  
**radial-gradient(circle, #008b8b 50%, transparent 50.5%) 59% 40%/16% 16%**  
creates a radial gradient with the following properties:

Shape: circle
Start color: #008b8b (teal) at 50%
End color: transparent at 50.5%
Position: 59% horizontal and 40% vertical
Size: 16% of the element's width and 16% of the element's height
To understand this statement, it's helpful to break it down into its individual parts:

radial-gradient(): This is the CSS function that creates a radial gradient.
circle: This specifies that the gradient should have a circular shape.
#008b8b 50%: This specifies that the gradient should start with the color #008b8b (teal) at 50% of the element's size.
transparent 50.5%: This specifies that the gradient should end with the color transparent (which is invisible) at 50.5% of the element's size.
59% 40%: This specifies the position of the gradient within the element. In this case, the gradient will be centered horizontally (59%) and slightly offset vertically (40%).
16% 16%: This specifies the size of the gradient. In this case, the gradient will be 16% of the element's width and 16% of the element's height.
Here is a diagram of what the resulting gradient would look like:

This type of gradient can be used to create a variety of visual effects, such as buttons, backgrounds, and borders. For example, it could be used to create a button with a teal border that fades to transparent on the outside, or a background with a teal center that fades to white on the edges.
